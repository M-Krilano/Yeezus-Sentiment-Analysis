    "## What's Up With Kanye West?\n",
    "Ever since I was in middle school I've been a huge Kanye West fan. I'm talking about pink-polo, white sunglasses and backpack Kanye...the old Kanye. I don't want to get tangled into the political drama that's going on with Kanye and his relationship with Trump; however, I am concerned for Kanye's mental health since he publicly stated he's depressed. It's understandable though, he's got a lot going on his plate from being a husband to Kim K, fathering three beautiful children, running his fashion line, and other \"dope shit\". It seemed like he was a lot happier back when he was young and choppin' up beats and interuppting Taylor Swift at award shows...or maybe that's just what I want to believe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis:\n",
    "I hypothesize that Ye was significantly happier and more positive back in his early career than the current yeezy we all know today.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Side Note:\n",
    "Unfortunately Kanye only joined twitter in 2010 which was after a lot of his big albums, so I decided to take tweets from 2010 to 2012 (before he started dating Kim K) and use that for the \"old_kanye\" data set and use tweets from 2017 to present for the \"current_kanye\" data set \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update (after extracting all of Ye's tweets):\n",
    "Kanye is Kanye and deletes his tweets all the time so the oldest tweets I can extract are from early April 2018 and one tweet from 2014. So I will just have to run a sentiment analysis on the data I have and won't be able to compare old and new tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method:\n",
    "1. I'm going to extract Kanye's tweets and insert them in a table in a mysql database\n",
    "    (json, tweepy, mysql_connector)\n",
    "2. Query specific data to make my data set\n",

    "To extract Data from Twitter:\n",
    "- tweepy: twitters API that allows me to grab tweets\n",
    "- json: allows me to change the extract tweets, which comes in \"tweepy.models.ResultSet\", then dumps it into a\n",
    "  json string, then loads it into a list of dictionaries (each dictionary is a tweet containing a Tweet Object)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \"The Tweet object has a long list of ‘root-level’ attributes, including fundamental attributes such as 'id',\n",
    "  'created_at', and 'text'. Tweet objects are also the ‘parent’ object to several child objects. Tweet child\n",

    "- bs4: decodes HTML to general text\n",
    "- nltk: tokenizes words\n",

    "- Word Cloud Library: to create some summary visualisations of our tweets\n",

    "#### NLP:\n",
    "Pre-Processing steps in NLP:\n",
    "1. Look at char length of text, plot it, and see if there's anything odd (sanitation)  \n",
    "1. Remove HTML, punctuation, special characters(twitter handlers), and stop words\n",
    "2. Normalisation (stemming)\n",
    "3. Tokenisation.\n",
